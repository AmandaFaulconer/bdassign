# bdassign

Creates a database using PHP that requires a member account with a username and login. 
I used it for a snowboard database but you can use whatever you want. 
The pages will allow for different user interaction. There are pages for creating a new memebership,
login, logout, adding information into the database, display the database, adding and viewing images. 

The entire project has a stylesheet attached using css.
